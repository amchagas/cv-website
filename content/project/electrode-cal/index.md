A project developed for the [Singer Lab](<www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/454349/research>), based on [Sinkala et al 2012](<https://github.com/Sussex-Neuroscience/electrode-calibration/blob/master/literature/Sinkala%20et%20al.%20-%202012%20-%20Electrode%20calibration%20with%20a%20microfluidic%20flow%20cell%20for%20fast-scan%20cyclic%20voltammetry.pdf>) we developed a 3D printable microfluidic chamber for electrode calibration. These calibrated electrodes are normally used in Voltammetry applications.
