Open Neuroscience is a user-driven database of Open Source/Science projects related to Neurosciences:

- It serves as a curated space, where users can register their projects with short descriptions and topic classifications.
- Registered content can be filtered, searched, and all projects in a certain topic quickly compared, so that users can find what is most fitting for their needs.
- Having all projects listed under one place, also gives them visibility and hopefully helps in terms of bringing users/collaborators to them, making sure developing efforts are not wasted.
