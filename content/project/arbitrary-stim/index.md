Built as a collaboration of the [Baden lab](<badenlab.org>) and the [Euler Lab](<http://www.eye-tuebingen.de/eulerlab/>), this spatial stimulator is able to use most of the commercially available LEDs, making it quite flexible in terms of wavelength spectra. It can take up to 6 different LEDs and be synchronised with most microscope systems. 

**More details are available on its [publication](<https://elifesciences.org/articles/48779>)**
