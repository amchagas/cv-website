abstract: "This paper aims to describe the need for a course that teaches open source principles, 3D printing, and programming to researchers in Africa. It also describes the implementation of the course in detail so that others may conduct similar programs.   The primary goal of the “Open Labware: 3D Printing Your Own Lab Equipment” workshop organised by TReND in Africa (Teaching and Research in Natural Sciences for Development in Africa) is to help the development of local expertise and capabilities of researchers and teaching faculty in the area of Open Labware, capacitating participants to create their own scientific equipment, as well as repair existing ones."
