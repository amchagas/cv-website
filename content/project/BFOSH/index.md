[BFOSH]( https://fosh-following-demand.github.io/en/home) is a mentoring program developed during my fellowship with [Mozilla]() and [Freies Wissen](). It can be summarized as follows: 
1. In order to increase the reach and importance of Open Source Hardware in Science, we should developing research and educational tools based on demand. 
2. To learn what this demand was/is a survey was sent asking people what tools they needed in their institutions/community projects.
3. Once the survey was concluded, a call for developers was made, and groups from different places in the world were supported with the components they needed to build a certain equipemnt, as well as weekly calls with assigned mentors to debate obstacles and help with other non-physical resources.
