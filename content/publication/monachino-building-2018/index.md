abstract: "The first edition of the Aspects of Neuroscience Brainhack took place at the Department of Physics at University of Warsaw, Poland between November 17th and 19th 2017. This hackathon was one of the satellite events of the Aspects of Neuroscience conference, it was organized by the Brainhack organization to promote interaction between researchers, encouraging open (neuro)science and collaborations on projects related to the study of the nervous system. The event had a total of nine projects on many different topics including functional connectivity research, white matter tractography, classification of brain-ageing biomarkers through machine learning, presentation of a portable one channel EEG registration device and a do it yourself 3D-printed neurobiology lab. The latter is highlighted in this paper."
