abstract: "We report on a workshop based on open source principles to implement innovative solutions for laboratories and science applications in Africa. Specifically, 3D printed designs and electronic circuit designs implemented by different research teams from Africa are highlighted. The advanced open labware workshop enabled teams to develop setups to solve challenges faced in their own laboratories or research environments. The workshop showed that substantial developments could be made within a two week time frame, particularly using rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and laser cutting to accelerate the development of the open labware solutions."
