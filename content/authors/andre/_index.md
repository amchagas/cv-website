Hi! Welcome to my personal website.

I'm passionate about open science and open source hardware, and how those two can be used to increase research and education reach around the world. I have a background in Neurosciences and have been developing affordable open science hardware and teaching others to do so via workshops, talks and outreach events.

I started [Open Neuroscience](<https://open-neuroscience.com>), and volunteer at [Trend in Africa](<https://www.trendinafrica.org>) as an open source adviser and by organizing and running Open Labware workshops.

Currently I work at the [Department of Neurosciences](<http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sussexneuroscience/>) in the University of Sussex, where I develop equipment to support research labs. For more details on those projects check the [Open Sussex Neuroscience page](<https://sussex-neuroscience.github.io/>)

On my spare time I offer consultancy services around open science hardware through [Prometheus Science](<https://prometheus-science.com>). If you need to replicate a methods paper, or if you'd like something custom built for your lab, get in touch!  
 
If you would like to get in touch, drop me a line using the [contact form](#contact) at the end of this page!
