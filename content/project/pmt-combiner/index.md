This project got started when there was the need to combine the signals coming out
of two photo multiplier tubes (PMTs) installed in one of the 2-photon microscopes at the microscopy unit in Sussex Neuroscience.

The particular PMTs installed were models [PM2101](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=PMT2101/M) from Thorlabs. This means that they are actually a "combo" of PMT plus current to voltage converter, and the output signal from the unit is voltage. 

More technical details can be found on the project repository: https://github.com/sussex-neuroscience/pmt-combiner/
